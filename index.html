<label for="cb1" class="tab__label"> What is a Mezuzah?</label>
<div class="tab__content">
<p>A Mezuzah is a parchment which we affix to our doorposts, on which a scribe has hand-written two paragraphs from the Torah: The portion of 'Sh'ma Yisroel' ("Hear O Israel...") in the Book of Devarim (Deuteronomy 6:4-9), and the portion of 'V'hoyo-im-shamoa' ("And it shall happen if you obey...") in Devarim (Deuteronomy 11:13-21.) In these paragraphs, G-d states that great rewards await those who observe the Mitzvot, including prosperity, success and long life. Each of the two paragraphs includes a commandment to affix a Mezuzah on the doorpost.</p>
<p>These portions are written on the parchment with special ink, by a highly trained and certified scribe. The text is written in a single column on 22 scored lines. Every letter must be properly written, for even one letter written incorrectly invalidates the Mezuzah.</p>
<p>On the back of the parchment is written the word 'Sha-dai', along with certain other letters. After the scribe has completed his writing, the parchment is rolled (not folded or creased) from left to right, so that the first word to appear when the Mezuzah is opened is 'Sh-ma'. The Mezuzah is then placed in a protective cover or case and is ready to be put up on the doorpost.</p>

<label for="cb2" class="tab__label">Mezuzah Quality Guide</label>
<div class="tab__content">

<p>Many customers wish to purchase Mehudar Sifrei Torah, Tefillin, and Mezuzot (STa"M), but the definitions for writing Mehudar STa"M are not explicitly stated in the Talmud or in Poskim. These definitions have been passed down from rabbi to student and from scribe to apprentice.. Our goal is to try to present the main differences between what is considered a Mehudar and what is not.</p>
<p>Generally, the definitions are divided into two categories. The first is related to the halachic (legal) world and halachic definitions, while the second is more related to the form and beauty of the script. However, these definitions are intertwined. For example, in the halachic definition, it is forbidden to have an unnecessary space between sections, and this space is generally defined as the width of nine letters. Therefore, if there is a space of nine letters between words where it is not necessary, the tefillin or mezuzah would be invalid.</p>
<p><b>● Mehudar A+:</b></p>
<p>1. Ensure there are four distinct strokes on the Aleph, in addition to the five components.</p>
<p>2. The right Yud should be connected to the body at its midpoint or close to it, and definitely not near its edge.</p>
<p><b>Mehudar A, Mehudar, Mehudar B:</b></p>
<p>1. Ensure most of the strokes on the Aleph are present, even if the left stroke on the body is not very prominent.</p>
<p><b>Mehudar A, Mehudar, Mehudar B:</b></p>
<p>1. Ensure most of the strokes on the Aleph are present, even if the left stroke on the body is not very prominent.</p>
<p><b>● Kosher Lechatchila A+:</b></p>
<p>1. There is no strict requirement for the strokes on the Aleph.</p>
<p>2. Ensure the Yuds are not connected to the body at its edge, even if they are close to it.</p>
<p><b>● Kosher Lechatchila B, Kosher Letchatchila:</b></p>
<p>1. Sometimes part of the Yuds of the Aleph may be connected at the edge, ensuring that no letter has both Yuds connected at the edge, which would invalidate the letter.</p>
<p>2. The middle line of the letter is not always straight but should not resemble a Resh.</p>
<p>3. The upper Yud may sometimes be as tall as a Vav or as long as a Resh.</p>
<p>4. The right Yud of the Aleph may be inverted or its leg may not extend from the right edge of the roof.</p>
<p><b>● Kosher: The letter is defined as kosher according to the poskim, even if it includes elements that are considered valid only after the fact, such as an Aleph body resembling a Resh or Yuds that are unusually large.</b></p>
<p><b>● If the Yuds of the Aleph are connected to its body at the same point, the Aleph cannot be defined as kosher without consultation with a halachic authority.</b></p>

<label for="cb3" class="tab__label">How to fulfill the Mitzvah?</label>
<div class="tab__content">
<p>To fulfill the Mitzvah of Mezuzah properly and to have its protection, three parts of the Mitzvah must be fulfilled. (If any of these three parts is not fulfilled, the Mitzvah is not performed.)</p>
<p>1) It must be written properly by a certified scribe. Since the laws of writing a Mezuzah are very intricate and include thousands of details, a non-certified scribe is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>2) It must be properly inspected by certified professional examiners and should additionally be computer scanned to verify textual accuracy. Note: After examining over 40,000 Mezuzot, we found 16% to be Possul(invalid) and of all of those that were found to be invalid, 93% were never acceptable in the first place. That is why it is so important to purchase only reliable Kosher Mezuzot. Although deterioration can occur, most of the problems exist from the time of purchase. That is why a certificate of Kashrut is so important. All the Mezuzot & Tefillin we sell have been carefully inspected and computer scanned to ensure maximum levels of Kashrut.</p>

<p>3) It must be properly installed. Note: After conducting thousands of house calls, we found the statistics to be very disheartening: 96% of the homes were found to have installation problems (such as Mezuzot installed upside-down, missing Mezuzot, some installed on the left side of the opening instead the right side, some installed more than 3 and 1/2 inches away from the opening, etc.)</p>

<p>A Mezuzah is not an amulet. The Rambam indicates that to treat it as one degrades the Mitzvah. Nevertheless, one of the special benefits of the Mitzvah is that it protects he who performs the Mitzvah from harm that may otherwise befall him.</p>

<p>Men and women alike are obligated in the Mitzvah of Mezuzah, which can be fulfilled during the day or at night. The Rambam concludes the Halachot (laws) of Mezuzah with this statement: One must be very punctilious in fulfilling this Mitzvah because it is a constant obligation that includes everyone. Every time a person enters and leaves, he is confronted with the Unity of G-d, the name of the Almighty, and he remembers his love for Him. He awakens from his slumber and his involvement in the vanity of temporal matters and realizes that nothing has eternal existence but the knowledge of G-d. He then immediately returns to the path of righteousness. Our sages have said that he who has Tefillin on his arm and head, Tzitzit on his garment and Mezuzot on his doorways, can be assured that he will not sin, because he has many reminders. These are the selfsame angels that protect him from sin as it says, 'The angels of G-d surround those who fear Him and protect him.</p>

<p><b>Preparing The Parchment :</b></p>
<p>After the scribe has completed his writing, the parchment is rolled (not folded or creased) from left to right, so that the first word to appear when the Mezuzah is opened is "Sh-ma" (see Figure A). The Mezuzah is then wrapped in wax paper and placed into a protective cover.</p>
<p>The letters on the outside of the rolled Mezuzah parchment must be upright and facing the doorway (see Figure B). The Mezuzah is now ready to be affixed to the doorpost.</p>
<p><b>Places That Require a Mezuzah:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. All permanent dwellings need a Mezuzah.</li>
<li>2. The requirement extends to every interior room of a house as well, except for undignified areas such as bathrooms.</li>
<li>3. A storage or utility room that is in regular use, such as a garage or boiler room should have a Mezuzah.</li>
<li>4. A 'Succah' - used only for the holiday - does not need a Mezuzah but a trailer or camper - if used as a dwelling - must have a Mezuzah.</li>
<li>5. If a room has two entrances, both require a Mezuzah.</li>
<li>6. All hallways leading to a room that requires a Mezuzah, require a Mezuzah.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Where to Put the Mezuzah:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. The Mezuzah should be affixed on the doorpost, on the right, determined by way of entry into the room.</li>
<li>2. The Mezuzah should be placed within the upper third of the doorpost, (preferably the bottom of the upper third,) but not within the uppermost four inches.</li>
<li>3. It should be attached at an angle with the top slanting into the room. Sphardim follow the Shulchan Aruch who says that the Mezuzah should be affixed in a vertical upright position.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> When to Put Up the Mezuzah:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. If the home is owned by the dweller, the Mezuzot must be put up on the first day of moving in.</li>
<li>2. When moving into a rented home or apartment, you have up to 30 days to install the Mezuzot, though the sooner done, the better.</li>
<li>3. A Mezuzah can be installed during day or night.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Blessing:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Just before attaching the Mezuzah, one should say the following blessing: "Baruch Ata Ado-nai Elo-heinu Melech Haolam, Asher Kidshanu B'mitzvotav V'tzivanu Lik'boa Mezuzah." ("Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, King of Universe. Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix the Mezuzah.")</li>
<li>2. The Mezuzah, in its case, is then nailed, screwed or glued in place on the doorpost.</li>
<li>3. When putting up more than one Mezuzah, only one blessing is recited for all of them and one should not talk of, or get involved with other matters until all of the Mezuzot are affixed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> The blessing should be recited on an opening which has a door and leads to a room larger than 6x6 feet.</p>
<ul>
<li>4. Any household member of Bar or Bat Mitzvah age and above can recite the blessing and put up the Mezuzah.</li>
<li>5. Places that require a Mezuzah and a blessing include an entrance to a house, doorways more than 40 inches high and all rooms of the house.</li>
<li>6. The following need a Mezuzah but no blessing is recited:
• A room is more than 36 sq. feet, and one dimension of the room is less than 6 feet (example: a 4x10 room) then the Mezuzah is affixed without a blessing.
• Retail/wholesale stores, business offices, storage rooms, walk-in closets and rooms with no doors require Mezuzot but without the blessing.
<li>7. Bathrooms, saunas, doorways less than 36 inches high, rooms whose area is less than 36 sq. feet and temporary dwellings do not require a Mezuzah.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Please note:</b> Aside from the more obvious room settings, there are a variety of details which are not so clear-cut, and depending on a number of factors, Mezuzot may or may not be necessary. These factors are complicated and are based on :</p>
<ul>
<li>A. The definition of the usage of the room (dwelling, storage, synagogue, a store, gazebo, hallway, etc.)</li>
<li>B. The type of dwelling (temporary housing, inn, caravan, hospital, etc.)</li>
<li>C. The definition of ownership ( owner, renter, guest, partner with a gentile, etc.).</li>
<li>D. The definition of a "house" (square footage, height, a roof, etc.)</li>
<li>E. The construction of the opening (attic doors, one doorpost, rounded top, sliding doors, end of a wall, etc.)</li>
<li>F. The function of the opening (for decoration, supporting beams, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For clarity on what to do in such circumstances, or any other situation where a question may arise, please consult with a competent Rabbinic authority.</p>
